# A Motto

I can't believe it's taken me 6 posts to arrive here, but better late than never. Not 'my' motto, per se, but 'a' motto I enjoy that I claim ownership of: "I don't give a fuck about nothing". 

This seems juvenile and while it certainly is, I think it also elegantly codifies an attitude that is valuable and fleeting in today's world. There is always something better to be doing, some content or food to consume and some 'scientific, peer reviewed, undeniable' reason why you should be doing XYZ but after a certain point, I just don't care. 

I don't care that you are right, I don't care if this makes no sense, I don't care if this makes no money or is a waste of my time for a billion other reasons... I simply don't give a fuck about nothing. 

What can you say to a person that claims and apparently; "does not give a fuck about nothing". Well, nothing I guess - they are gonna do what they are gonna do. And that should be the attitude of more people. I might have reasons I am doing one thing over another, deep down I am sure I do. But on the surface, exclaiming that the reasons and justifications are irrelevant are paramount to risking what is necessary to do something, anything meaningful. 

So, yes, I don't give a fuck about nothing. And my response to your response to that is also; I don't give a fuck.
