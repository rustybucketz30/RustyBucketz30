# Financialization
The name of the game these days. I used a F5Bot keyboard searcher to track "financilization" on reddit, HN, and Github these past few days and it seems to pinpoint doomer discussions without fail. 

No further analysis here, just a word that may be mainstream pretty soon as it encapsulates a noticable portion of public frustration. I'm calling it.
