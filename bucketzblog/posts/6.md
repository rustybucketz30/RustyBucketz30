# Book Reviews

I'm not ready yet, but I am writing this to declare that I should review/digest the books I read on here going forward, I'll have to go back and 'review' the ones I've read already. And btw the goal is not for it to be a favoriable or critical reivew of the book whatsoever. Rather, just recognition of the parts I found meaningful and any interesting perspective(s) I gained while reading...along with any philosophical disagreements I have with the author, but hopefully those don't linger
