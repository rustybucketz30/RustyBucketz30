# Storytelling

I think storytelling might be one of the lasting "useful" things that humans can do apart from all else we've abstracted into our machines and processes. There is a lot more to unpack there but in that spirit I'd like to encourage myself to share stories on here when I can. As only a handful are remembered as life goes on and earlier when I asked myself: "Do I have any great stories?" I only really had one come to mind. I'll share that one soon

The other angle of this is to encourage myself to live my life in order to create new stories, which generally happens when I go beyond the confortable and normal - hopefully the next good story I generate isn't my last.
