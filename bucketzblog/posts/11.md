# Words to know

This could become a running list of sorts. Some words I find interesting for historical, practical or otherwise significant/interesting in one way or another. Here is a quick dump of the ones on my mind at this hour:
 - RSS (I guess I will count acronyms as words here too)
 - hacking
 - cracking
 - cypherpunk(s)
 - cryptoanarchy

Edgy list I know. But I find these may be suitable replacements for describing modern-day racketeers and terrorists in a way that is more fitting and technically accurate. RSS is the exception on this list.
