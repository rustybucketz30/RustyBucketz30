# Why?

While video content might be easier to consume, I find it's absorption in the consumer to be more transient than that of text content. Plus, most of my ideas come across as short, "tweet"-like thoughts unrelated to one another and worthy of their own space in my corner of the internet. 

It's ironic that I chose the VGT (Video Game Therapy) medium to be easiest for me, and here I am making it even easier since I've found that medium to have a higher barrier-of-entry(headphones on, OBS, figuring out what to do in the Minecraft world).
