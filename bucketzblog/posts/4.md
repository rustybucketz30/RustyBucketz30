# How?

Read these via RSS please. Stop using these shitty platforms to consume braindead content. At least make it a conscious effort of braindead consumption instead of a passive-by-default one. Don't know what RSS is? Figure it out - you probably have a college degree or some self-believed threshold of intelligence. Education should be learning how to learn, so learn what RSS is and what to do. It's not hard, just an exercise in effort and 10-minutes of focus. 

I'm not always this bitter, but the idea that "figure it the /e out" isn't a more mainstream response to a lack of knowledge befalls me. Effort is like 90% of it. You are probabyl way smarter than you give yourself credit for, you just refuse to try for some unknown reason - or at least a reason I don't feel like hypothesizing about a random passerby to my blog.
