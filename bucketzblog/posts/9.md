# My Superpower

I am a _master_ at starting random projects and not finishing them. I've realized it's difficult for me to not brandish this skill of mine at every possible juncture.

Seriously though, why do I do this. I have probably 10 half- or quarter-baked projects or ideas that I could reasonably finish with a few focused days of work (whole days that is...or several weeks of "hour here, hour there"). But I instead opt to start new projects in lieu of finishing or polishing up old ones - just a novelty race I suppose. 

So my new goal/thing is: one project per month, that's it. I need to finish them by the end of the month, or table it. And if I finish early, then I polish up until the end of the month. Here are my next 3 months worth of personal projects:
 - October: RustyBucketz30 Dotfiles
 - November: Publish this blog on blog.rustybucketz30.xyz
 - December: Learn Blender to make an intro/outro sequence for RustyBucketz30

There. I wrote it down so it will happen right? Idk, something like that.
